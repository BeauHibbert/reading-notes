SQL stands for Structured Query Language

SQL is a search language that allows for information to be retrieved from data bases. Data bases organize data in tables and SQL allows you to retrieve/add/delete information from the selected database.

Conditions are simply statements that are either true or false. The database takes these statements and evaluates them across all the rows as it scans through your tables and only returns the results that are true.

You can also use OR to define multiple WHERE conditions when you care whether not both but at least one of the conditions is true.

You can invert a condition by simply putting the NOT operator in front of it.

```Operator  	Description
 = 		      equal 
< 		      less than 
> 		      greater than 
<= 		      less than or equal 
>= 		      greater than or equal 
!= 		      not equal 
<> 		      not equal (yup, there are two ways)

Operator		      Description 
LIKE 			        a string matches a pattern 
ILIKE 			      case insensitive version of 
LIKE SIMILAR TO 	a string matches a regex pattern
```
