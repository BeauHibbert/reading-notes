# Javascript
"JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language."

Basically, Javascript allows you to add content like animations, sounds, and dynamically change the website. It's what gives a website some personality so it's not just text and colors.

The order in which a computer executes commands is called the control flow. Code runs from the first line to the last line in a file unless a conditional or loop prompts the code to interact with it.

## Functions

Functions are blocks of code designed to perform a certain task.

A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.

Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.

The code is "invoked" when something calls it 
* when a user clicks  button
* When it is called from the Javascript code
* Automatically or self invoked

When Javascript reaches a return statement the function will stop executing.

Functions are important because you can define the code once and use it many times saving time and potential bugs.

## Operators

* The assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.
* The addition operator (+) adds numbers:
* The multiplication operator (*) multiplies numbers.
* The addition assignment operator (+=) adds a value to a variable.
* The + operator can also be used to add (concatenate) strings.
* The += assignment operator can also be used to add (concatenate) strings:
