## Beau Hibbert
Hi, my name is Beau Hibbert, a student at codefellows. I studied economics at WSU before this and found out that it wasn't really for me. Instead of going back to college for several years, I decided to give codefellows a chance on the recommendation from my girlfriend, who also went through Codefellows a couple years ago. Here is my Github [profile](https://github.com/BeauHibbert)

## Growth Mindset 

A growth mindset is the key to success. A growth mindset is a mindset that someone who is able to learn and grow has. Instead of being or feeling limited to natural abilities or intelligence, a growth mindset pushes a person to grow and develop in the face of adversity and obstacles instead of falling down and giving up.

Here are a couple traits that people with a growth mindset tend to have.

-Effort- this is obviously important as when faced with an obstacle or hurdle it is important to not give up effort and focus.

-Attention
