## What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

“But here's a good starting place: The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers. These early personal computers weren't much more than toys. You could play pong or simple shooting games, maybe do some word processing. And these toys were marketed almost entirely to men and boys.” 

## Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

It was researched and discovered that families were more likely to buy computers for their sons than for their daughters growing up. As computers started becoming more common place in school, it became a problem when women got to college and professors assumed that everyone had grown up playing with computers, so when women enrolled in computer science degrees, a lot of them were behind because they didn’t have access to computers like a lot of boys did growing up.


## What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?

- There are more males in every single company.
- The ethnicity breakdown has ethnicities other than white increasing in almost every company.
- Most companies have gotten more diverse between 2014 and 2017

## When are diversity efforts most successful?

“Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters.”

## Why do diverse companies perform better?

“Study after study in fields like organizational science, psychology and education indicate that diversity offers significant benefits for teams focused on creativity and innovation.” “Given that diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones, it is unsurprising that a wealth of research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes.” “When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups.” “While diversity and inclusion efforts are most often driven by business rationales, we’ve spoken with a few CEOs who are motivated primarily by a belief that cultivating an inclusive tech community is simply the right thing to do.”

## Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

When Youtube was developing it’s IOS app, the team creating it was almost entirely right handed so it wasn’t really created with left handed people in mind. When it was rolled out, people had problems with the app and many videos were uploaded upside or with other problems.
