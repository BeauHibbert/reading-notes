# Writing on Github
Markdown is the languge used to write code on Github. Particularly for project README's
#Here is some basic syntax that is commonly used.

## Headings
The pound sign in front of the text is used to indicate a heading. 
Up to six heading can be used which means that each subsequent heading needs an extra pound sign.
### Heading 2
For example, this heading used two pound signs before the text.

## URL links
An inline link can be created by putting parenthesis around the text and brackets around the URL.

## Emojis
Emoji's are very simple to add, each one has its own unique name that you can type in and the emoji will pop right up.

There is of course much more syntax to go over but this is some of the basics.
