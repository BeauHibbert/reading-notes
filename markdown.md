## Headings
The pound sign in front of the text is used to indicate a heading. 
Up to six heading can be used which means that each subsequent heading needs an extra pound sign.
### Heading 2
For example, this heading used two pound signs before the text.

#### An inline link can be created by putting parenthesis around the text and brackets around the URL.
