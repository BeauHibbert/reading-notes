# HTML or hypertext markup languange

* HTML is a coding language that displays the content of your web page.
* HTML utilizes tags and elements to tell the content what it needs to do.

## The element

* The element is made up of four main parts.

1. The opening tag - this is the type of element that is being used.
2. The closing tag - this is the same as the opening tag but with a *forward slash* in front of the tag.
3. The content - this is simply the content that you would like to add to the web page.
4. The element - the three things above add up to make the full element.

# Wireframe

A wireframe is a way that UX designers use to plan and develop how a web page will look with the content. There are a number of ways to create a wireframe, several different apps, websites, even just a pen and piece of paper will work, all that is needed is a way to visualize the content of the web page. It is essentially a sketch of the web page. 

#### Here's what makes a good wireframe.

1. Maintaining clarity - it is important to maintain clarity so that the wireframe doesn't get too complicated and hard to implement.
2. Gain user confidence - It should be easy to navigate around the site and it should be clear what the website is intended to do.
3. To add on to the other ones, it is also very important to just keep it simple. A wireframe should not be a piece of art or have too much detail. It should really be just a simple sketch that is easy to follow.

Here are a couple helpful links to different websites that explain in more detail.
