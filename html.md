# HTML or hypertext markup lankguange

* HTML is a coding language that displays the content of your web page.
* HTML utilizes tags and elements to tell the content what it needs to do.

## The element

* The element is made up of four main parts.

1. The opening tag - this is the type of element that is being used.
2. The closing tag - this is the same as the opening tag but with a ~forward slash~ in front of the tag.
3. The content - this is simply the content that you would like to add to the web page.
4. The element - the three things above add up to make the full element.
