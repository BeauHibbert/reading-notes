# Text Editors
In order to code, a text editor is very important. Mac, windows, and linux all come with text editors already installed but are usually very barebones and don't have very many features. A third party text editor is then used. There are certain criteria that you should have in choosing a text editor.

1. Code completion
2. Syntax Highlighting
3. A nice variety of themes
4. The ability to choose different extensions when needed

Third party text editors are used by most developers, although everyone has their own preference on which is their favorite. Some are better than others but largely it depends on how you use the text editor and what you need to get from it.

Here are just some of the popular ones that are around today.
