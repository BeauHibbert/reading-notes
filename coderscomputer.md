# Text Editors
In order to code, a text editor is very important. Mac, windows, and linux all come with text editors already installed but are usually very barebones and don't have very many features. A third party text editor is then used. There are certain criteria that you should have in choosing a text editor.

* Code completion
* Syntax Highlighting
* A nice variety of themes
* The ability to choose different extensions when needed
