# CSS

CSS is a language used for styling web pages and making the user experience better. Combined with html, it can turn a very boring barebones html styled website into a beautiful easy to navigate one.

There are three ways of inserting a style sheet

* External CSS
* Internal CSS
* Inline CSS

External css is used when the entire look of the website needs to be changed at once.

In order to do this the html page must contain a reference to the external sheet file inside the <link> element inside the head section.

Internal css can be used if one html page just needs to be changed.

The internal css is added to the <style> element, inside the head section.

Finally, inline css can be used to style a single element.

The style attribute needs to be added to the relevant element.
